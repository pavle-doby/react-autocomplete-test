# Frontend test - Deel - Part 1

## How to run this project

0. Download this project & navigate to it's root(`react-autocomplete-test`) folder in terminal
1. Run: `npm install`
2. Run: `npm run dev`
3. Open **Local** address displayed in terminal (probably: http://localhost:5173/)

> P.S. This will certainly work with `node v18.13.0`

I hope you have a pleasant experience with my autocomplete, and that the code meets your standards. Please feel free to provide any feedback on how this can be improved; it would be very helpful and highly appreciated.
